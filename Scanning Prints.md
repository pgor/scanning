# Scanning Prints

## Be Clean

No, we're not archiving lost works of art for a museum. But there is no sense in adding gunk to images, especially when we're about to scan them in at a resolution that will reveal many flaws.

1. Wash your hands before starting.
2. As much as possible, follow best print-handling practices of touching only the edges.
3. Nathan has brought over many packets of "touchscreen cleaning wipes" to use as a cleaning cloth. These should be able to clean prints, slides, and the scanner without leaving behind any of their own lint.
4. I have ordered some white cotton gloves in large and small sizes. While it may feel hoity-toity, wearing them (especially while working with prints) should help avoid fingerprints when you inadvertently (and inevitably) touch the print face.
5. Drinks on the work surface are probably not a good idea.

## Getting Started

1. Open the lid. It needs to be pointing pretty much straight up to stay open on its own.
2. Verify the white "document mat" is in place on the lid. (It will be removed if slides or negatives were the last things scanned.) If needed, replace it by sliding it on so the four tabs are held by the notches.
3. Gently wipe the document mat with the cleaning cloth to remove any dust and other dirt.
4. Wipe the scanner glass with the cleaning cloth to remove dirt and dust. Wiping it away from the hinge seems like the best way, so anything you don't pick up is on a portion of the glass that we rarely scan. Fingerprints and smudges can usually be removed with just the dry cleaning cloth, but you could use windex if you really feel necessary--just spray onto the cloth, not directly onto the glass, to avoid any excess flowing through the edge cracks into the main scanner body.
5. Power on the scanner. Power button is on right side, toward the back and bottom.

### Configuring Scanner Software

1. Launch "EPSON Scan". If it starts scanning automatically, press the Cancel or Pause button (whichever appears).
2. Choose "Home Mode" from the drop down menu ("Full Auto Mode" may be selected--that won't give us the ability to define what area of the screen should be scanned, and usually results in non-photo area included in the scan. This takes extra time and storage space that we just don't want.)
3. Set Document Type to "Photo".
4. Set Image Type to "Color" (even if it's a black and white photo).
5. Set Destination to "Other", and resolution to "1200", Target Size to "Original" (you usually don't have the ability to change that with these settings, but I mention it just in case).
6. None of the Image Adjustments options should be checked.
7. For completeness, you might want to check that the "Brightness" settings are 0 for both Brightness and Contrast.
8. I haven't found a need to adjust anything in the "Configuration" panel.

If during your use of the software, it puts up an alert saying it couldn't communicate with the scanner, it most likely powered down. You'll need to power it on again, and it's possible you may need to launch EPSON Scan.

### Configuring Output Location

1. Click the "File Save Settings" button to the right of the "Scan" button, which will open a screen to configure where to save the files and what to name them.
2. For "Location", choose "Other" then click the "Choose" button to point out the directory to store the files in. [add more specific location info here]
3. Don't worry about "File Name" right now, we'll discuss it in a bit after checking the rest of the settings.
4. Image Format should be "Multi-TIFF (*.tif)"--which is not the same as just "TIFF".
5. "Overwrite any files with the same name" should be unchecked. If you accidentally change the naming so it matches something already scanned, we don't want it to silently delete the previous scan. [will need to check what it actually does with a conflict so it's not a surprise]
6. Unchecking "Show this dialog box before next scan" will reduce the annoying tedium of scanning multiple images. If you forget, I'm confident you will disable it after the third or fourth image scanned.
7. I leave "Open image folder after scanning" checked so I can do a quick look at the new image file if I want.
8. Check "Show Add Page dialog after scanning"--this is what enables us to put multiple scans into one file.

### File Names

There are many different pieces of information we could embed in a file name. For example, if we knew the date of the photo we could call it "photo\_1968-10-26\_001.tif". The problems are a) knowing that information at the time of scan, and b) this interface is kind of a pain to try changing the file name for each scan you do.

In the "File Name" setting there are two fields, the Prefix and Start Number. The name will be the combination of those two fields, with the number automatically increasing for each scan. So if set them to "prefix\_" and "001", the first scan will be "prefix\_001", the next "prefix\_002", etc.

I have settled on a simpler naming system that enables much more braindead repetitive scanning, and we can deal with gathering photo info later. The main goal is to be able to find the source photo for an image if we feel we need to rescan it. Prints are going to be difficult to organize as tightly as slides, but consider something like "photo\_box1\_" for the prefix, and resetting the Start Number to 001 (three-digits is the only option here, but you don't have to type them all in). Then each new box you would label on the outside, and adjust the file name to "photo\_box2\_" and "001" and continue on.

If you want or need to go back and add to a "batch name" that was already scanned, look through those files to find the highest numbered one and adjust the Start Number to be the next number in sequence (e.g. if there is already "photo\_box1\_024.tif", the next file name should be set to "photo\_box1\_" and "025").

## Preparing the Photo

1. To avoid adding fingerprint smudges, it is probably best to wear white cotton gloves while working with photos. But you're an adult, you can judge how careful you can be.
2. Shake out the cleaning cloth to remove any dirt from previous use.
3. Place the photo face up in front of you on the desk or table, then wipe it off with the cleaning cloth. Not trying to get it pristine here, just eliminate as many dust specks as we can without worrying about damaging the photo.
4. When picking up a photo that is lying flat, I find it best to "spatula" it up using a firm piece of paper, avoiding curling it or creasing it with your fingers. I have been using a spare duplicate photo I wrote "scraper" on.
5. Pick up the photo and flip it over horizontally (left-to-right or right-to-left).
6. Place it face down on the scanner glass in the top right corner. There is an arrow on the scanner's plastic to remind you that it will be the scanned image's top left corner.
7. Close the lid. You don't have to be timid about it, but be somewhat gentle or it is likely the tiny breeze it generates might move the image's placement.

## Scanning

1. Click the "Preview" button. The scanner will do a quick low-resolution scan and present it to you in a new Preview window. Verify that the image hasn't shifted on the glass.
2. At the top, change from "Thumbnail" mode to "Normal". This usually only needs to be done the first time you scan since launching the app. If you need to reposition the image, do so then do another preview.
3. If this the first scan of the session, drag out a selection rectangle ("marquee") around the image to indicate what area you want scanned. It's usually easiest to start from the lower right and drag to the top left, since the rectangle will automatically end at the edge of the scanning area.
4. If this is not the first scan of the session, the marquee will remain unchanged from the previous scan. You should just need to adjust the right and bottom edges by dragging them with the mouse. You can move the whole marquee by click inside it and dragging it around.
5. Don't worry too much about getting a precise rectangular selection. Images aren't cut exactly square, they don't necessarily line up tight to the edge of the glass, etc. Err on the side of selecting a bit too much rather than worrying about cropping out rough edges at this point.
6. Sometimes you might accidentally create a second marquee while trying to reposition the first. When that happens, pressing "Scan" will only scan the currently selected marquee, which is indicated by the shifting dashed border (commonly called "marching ants"). You can delete the extra marquee by selecting it, then clicking the "Delete marquee" button with the terrible icon in the top left in the "Marquee" section of the window's side toolbar.
7. If you really feel you need a larger preview, you can a) enlarge the window it's in, or b) click the Zoom button which will do a slightly higher-resolution scan to show you a larger version.
8. Go back to the main EPSON Scan window and click "Scan". You shouldn't need to close the preview window, it will get updated next time you preview.
9. Wait until the scan is done.
10. If you wish, verify that the scanned image is what you expect it to be.
11. Repeat scan if you wish, but hopefully you repeat with the next image and keep making progress.
12. Open scanner lid and remove the image by "spatula", place it in a completed stack or box.
13. Prepare, load, and scan the next print.
